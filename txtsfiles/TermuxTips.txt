This is a simple log file for what I did on this terminal emulator to get track and 
get able to reproduce it anywhere else.

-Installed vim and downloaded my vimrc file
    -The commands are:
        -$ pkg install vim
        -$ pkg install git
        -$ git clone https://github.com/LucasBelon/DebianBelonRepo
    -Then created the /.vim/ folder with undodir and backup as subdirectories
        -$ mkdir -p ~/.vim/undodir ~/.vim/backup
        -$ cp ~/DebianBelonRepo/vimrc ~/.vim/vimrc

-Added the Storage permissions to the app, so we can access the internal storage
    -$ termux-setup-storage
    -Created a symlink to be able to access it as if it was a directory inside the ~/
     directory
    -Commands:
        -$ ln -s /storage/emulated/0 ~/storage
    -Now we're able to use things like images and any other file from our device

-Installed locate to be able to find files easily
    -$ pkg install locate && updatedb

-Installed apache2 and some settings
    -Downloaded apache2 and started it (it gives us a error message, but do not fear)
        -$ pkg install apache2
        -$ apachectl
    -Added a symlink to be able to access the apache2 file that is responsible for the index.html
     that runs our localhost:8080
        -$ ln -s ~/../usr/share/apache2/default-site/htdocs/ apache_htdocs

 -Installed gh on this device following the step-by-step script
    -Now I can continue studying C lang on a new, smaller device. Amazing

-Learned how to go online from localhost
    -With open ssh and apache2, with apache running we need to
    access "localhost.run" and establish a ssh tunneling from
    your machine to the world. It's kind of magical
