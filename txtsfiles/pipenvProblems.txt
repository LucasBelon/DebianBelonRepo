When I installed the pipenv with pip3 it said that the binaries
weren't on PATH, so, in order to put them, on the raspberry pi 
machine, i've run the following command:
$ echo "export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
It worked well. After it, just run 
source ~/.bashrc
and my pipenv worked fine
