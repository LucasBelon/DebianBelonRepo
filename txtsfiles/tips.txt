<<ssh_connection
    In order to make a simple (I mean, a really basic) ssh connection you'll need a few things:
    a ssh client program (we'll use openssh, it was already installed on debian)
    a ssh server program (I've installed it on bodhi linux)
    a login and password, plus the ip adress of the server machine.
    When doing:
    $ ip addr
    We can get the ip address, and with 
    $ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    we can install our server. Now, on the client machine we need to do:
    $ ssh login@ip_addr
    It will be something like this:
    $ ssh ruan@192.168.8.1
    The user must be configured on the server machine before, and I'm not the best person to
    explain how to do it, but as soon as I find out I'll gather this here.
    To do this I'm using two virtual machines, both are on CLI mode, so they won't explode my weak
    pc when they start things up.

    How do I know if the ssh server is up?
    $ sudo systemctl status ssh
    How do I stop it?
    $ sudo service ssh stop
    How do I make it run again?
    $ sudo service ssh start
    How do I make it sleep until I say it to wake up?
    $ sudo systemctl disable ssh
    How do I say it to wake up?
    $ sudo systemctl enable ssh

    When doing the connection between pc and raspberry, the IP should be static.
    # Configurations at /etc/dhcpcd.conf must include lines below:
    interface wlan0
    static ip_address=xxx.yyy.z.abc/30
    static ip6_address=xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::xx/xx
    static routers=xxx.xxx.x.x
    static domain_name_servers=xxx.xxx.x.x x.x.x.x xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::x

<<LoggedOut_Login
    If you logged out you'll need to know the repo name. If you change the repo name
    then the "remote add" gets cancelled. So, you must do
    $ git remote remove origin
    And then redo the connection with
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:<GitUserName>/<NameOfRepo>.git
    It will work if you cloned one of yours repositories and want to control them
    and make some push on them.
    And if none of this works, try to follow the instructions that comes after the
    following command:
    $ git branch -M main
    At last, need to test it by doing:
    $ git push -u origin main
    Author: Lucas Gouveia Belon, a brazilian guy.
    A easier way:
    $ git remote remove origin && git remote add origin git@github.com:YourName/YourRepo.git && git branch -M main && git push -u origin main

<<How_to_un_able_GUI
First Way: 
    In order to activate and de-activate the GUI mode and change to the
    CLI mode, you'll need to set it with systemctl (system control)
    To find out what is the standard interface of your system you can use:
    $ systemctl get-default
    If it is "graphical.target" then your standard interface is the GUI
    If it is "multi-user.target" then your standard interface is the CLI
    --To change from GUI to CLI:
    $ systemctl set-default multi-user.target
    $ systemctl reboot
    --To change from CLI to GUI:
    $ systemctl set-default graphical.target
    $ systemctl reboot
Second Way: (it doesn't worked on Debian)
    --To change from GUI to CLI:
    $ sudo service lightdm stop &
    --To change from CLI to GUI:
    $ sudo service lightdm start &
    [When i switched from GUI to CLI, neofetch sofware pointed that the memory usage
    went from about 600MiB to near 180MiB, and using ps -aux the processes went from
    180 to about 130. If it's a really good tip this one (if you know how to use it
    without accessing a internet browser]

<<How_to_avoid_bash_path
    When we're at a deep directory things can get really boring. The command line will show 
    something like
    user@machine:~/Projects/GitProj/scratch/.git/objects/info$ 
    And it's really anoying, there's no room in the line. You can make things different by
    changing some few lines on the ~/.bashrc file
    The enviroment variable we're looking at is PS1. If you change it with some text editor to, 
    let's say,
    PS1="\u > "
    It will show "<username> > ". And you'll be able to know where you are with the command
    $ pwd 
    What I choose to do is to open a terminal from your first terminal, then write:
    $ export PS1="> "
    The terminal line will become minimalist, and your normal terminal will remain unchanged.
    In gnome you can open a terminal window by:
    $ gnome-terminal &
    And then running the export. The .bashrc file is read everytime we open the terminal, so
    don't try to do those stuff on a real terminal. It can mess with your pc. Do it 
    only on pseudo-terminals.
    You can open a "new" terminal inside your terminal by writing 
    $ bash
    Then you can use the $ export PS1="> "
    and then exit. It will take you back to the normal terminal, without any changes.

<<internet_lookup
    When we're using the CLI only it's useful to be able to access the internet, 
    $ sudo apt-get install links
    It works really well, and is very pretty

    When we want to learn about internet stuff we need the tools for it
    $ sudo apt-get install net-tools
    We need to know the doors in our house, so...
    $ sudo ifconfig
    will show some info of those doors.
    To shut down our doors we can use:
    $ sudo ifconfig enp0s3 down
    and to reverse
    $ sudo ifconfig enp0s3 up
    What about to change the IP?
    $ sudo ifconfig enp0s3 10.0.2.10 netmask 255.255.255.0
    What are the routes that our machine has?
    $ sudo route

    What about checking our doors? More tools, this time a port scan
    $ sudo apt-get install nmap
    it must be used with the IP that we want to scan
    $ sudo nmap 127.0.0.1
